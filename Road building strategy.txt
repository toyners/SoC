General strategy
Look for locations that give the most return AND make sense for building infrastructure (road, settlement)

Road builder strategy
Initial infrastructure setup
Find the best brick and lumber producers (GameBoard.GetResourceProducerOrderedByProductionFactor(ResourcesType) returns Tuple<HexIndex, PF>)
	- If production factor is too low for either or both producers then switch strategy
Find best locations on those producers
	- Best location criteria in order of priority
		a) locations shared by both producers (1 settlement can collect both, use second settlement for other resource capture
		b) locations on producer AND port that ships that resource (very rare)
		c) locations closest to grain and wool resource (allows building of settlements)
		d) locations closest to port
	- Regardless of best location always settle on the producers if possible

Road building
  Place roads towards best grain and wool producers

Game play
Build towards best grain and wool producers
	- best location 
Accrue resources for building settlements/cities/development cards
