Road builder strategy
Initial infrastructure setup
Find the best brick and lumber producers
	- If production factor is too low for either or both producers then switch strategy
Find best locations on those producers
	- Best location criteria in order of priority
		a) locations shared by both producers (1 settlement can collect both, use second settlement for other resource capture
		b) locations on producer AND port that ships that resource (very rare)
		c) locations close to grain and wool resource (allows building of settlements)
		d) locations close to port
	- Regardless of best location always settlement on the producers if possible
